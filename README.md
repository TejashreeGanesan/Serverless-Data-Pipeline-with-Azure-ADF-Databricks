# Serverless-Data-Pipeline-with-Azure-ADF-Databricks

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **serverless data processing pipeline** on **Microsoft Azure**, designed for **healthcare data analytics**.
Using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** for orchestration and **Azure Databricks** as the processing engine, the pipeline ingests raw healthcare data (patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and procedures), applies robust **ETL transformations**, and delivers curated datasets for advanced analytics.

The solution demonstrates how cloud-native data engineering practices can enable **scalability, automation, and actionable insights** in real-world domains like healthcare.

## 📌 Key Highlights

✔ End-to-End **serverless data pipeline**
✔ Automated **ingestion → transformation → analysis**
✔ **Multi-layered storage** (Raw → Processed → Analyzed)
✔ **Delta Lake integration** for optimized queries
✔ Actionable insights: patient behavior, doctor performance, and revenue trends
✔ Scalable & cost-efficient with **on-demand Databricks clusters**

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Azure Data Factory** – Pipeline orchestration
* **Azure Databricks (PySpark)** – Distributed data processing
* **Azure Blob Storage** – Multi-container storage (raw, source, destination)
* **Delta Lake** – Optimized storage format
* **SQL Analytics** – Business intelligence & reporting

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**

   * Upload raw CSV healthcare datasets to Azure Blob Storage
   * ADF pipelines move and validate data

2. **Data Transformation (ETL)**

   * Databricks notebooks clean, deduplicate, and enrich data
   * Business logic applied: patient summaries, doctor performance, revenue analysis

3. **Data Storage & Optimization**

   * Store processed data in Parquet & Delta formats
   * Partitioning, compression, and schema enforcement for efficiency

4. **Analytics & Insights**

   * Generate KPIs: appointment distribution, patient churn, specialization demand
   * Enable reporting for healthcare decision-making

---

## 📊 Results

✔ Successfully ingested, transformed, and stored healthcare datasets
✔ Analytical reports on:

* First-time vs. returning patients
* Revenue trends across doctors & specializations
* Appointment distribution (daily/weekly/monthly)
  ✔ Optimized pipelines with **partitioning & Delta Lake performance features**
  ✔ Robust monitoring & error handling in ADF + Databricks

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project showcases:

* Designing **serverless pipelines** in Azure
* Building **scalable ETL workflows** with PySpark
* Implementing **cloud-native best practices** (decoupled storage & compute, monitoring, CI/CD-ready pipelines)
* Applying **data engineering to real-world healthcare analytics**

Would you like me to enhance this README further with **badges and sample screenshots sections** (placeholders where you can add images of ADF pipelines/Databricks notebooks)? That would make it look even more polished to recruiters.
